You are a Senior Creative Director + Senior Frontend Architect + Luxury Ecommerce UX Designer.

Build a HIGH-END storytelling saree ecommerce website using Next.js 14 (App Router) and GSAP animations.

Goal:
Create an emotionally engaging, premium storytelling saree ecommerce website inspired by Indian handcrafted saree storytelling brands, but more immersive and cinematic.

Pages to build: Home (featured sarees), Shop (all products with filters by category/price), Product Detail (large image from Cloudinary, description, add to cart), Cart, Login/Register, My Orders, and an Admin Dashboard.

Key frontend concepts to implement:
Fetch API calls to your Spring Boot backend. Store the JWT token in localStorage and attach it to every request via the Authorization header. Handle the cart in JavaScript state (array of items + quantities).
